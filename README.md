build and upload to the tinyscreen+ device

# Background

When playing badminton (especially doubles) I find it very difficult to know in which half of the court I should be standing, who will be serving, the current score. Partly that's because I'm dyslexic and partly because I get carried away with the intensity of the competition. I'm not unique, lots of people have difficulty keeping score. 

The idea of handing all that over to a simple "Wearable" so that I could have something to tell me, where to stand, who was going to serve and to whom and what the current score was occured to me.

I talked about this with Johan one of my badminton friends. He also has an interest in arduino programing and soon after our discussion came up with a simple prototype that could keep track of the score.

The (image) second prototype based on adafruit feather zero and screen, took things much further. Fitting the rapidly expanding functionality into the limited memory available on Arduino feather was a challenge and Making the case pushed my wood working abilities, such as they are, to the their limit. The device too big to be worn on the wrist was worn on a belt during play.

This prototype proved that such a device was workable, and importantly I found it a considerable help while playing. I can't say I always stood in the right place but the number of times my partner had to point out once again that I was in the wrong place was much less. 

The third iteration of this idea was based on the Tinyscreen+ device. This powerful device opened up many possibilities and these have been incorparated into the software.
